                        "The most important thing I learned during my two years 
                        of introspect was to accept myself for who I am. We were 
                        poured into by the best teacher I know. She went above 
                        and beyond to make sure we learned not only more about 
                        dance, but more about ourselves as humans." <br>

                        "I would recommend introspect to every dancer that wants 
                        to grow. I was so nervous when I first applied, but this 
                        is such a safe place to learn. You find your true self 
                        and learn how to move and think in your own way." <br>
