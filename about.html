                            The Introspect Experience is a unique summer experience 
                            designed for dancers 12+ who are interested in 
                            cultivating their artistic expression through 
                            collaboration, internal reflection, improvisation, 
                            and intention. Creator and Artistic Director, 
                            Megan Long, designed this program to inspire 
                            pre-professional dancers to value their inherent 
                            worth and discover what makes them a one of a kind 
                            mover, creator, and human.
